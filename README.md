## Installation
1. Go to the directory on your computer in your command line where you want to store the application.
2. Clone the repo with `git clone https://github.com/flynno-io/make-a-readme.git`.
3. Next navigate to the new repo with `cd make-a-readme`.
4. Install the node modules with `npm install`.
5. The application is ready to go launch with `npm run create-readme`.

## Usage
From the root of the make-a-readme directory, launch the application with `npm run create-readme`. 

Next, you will answer all of the prompts after reading them carefully. 

Finally, upon submitting your last prompt, the LICENSE.txt and README.md files will be created using your answers. Both files will be created in the src/results/ directory.

***WARNING***: If you already have a README.md and/or LICENSE.txt file, these will be overwritten with any subsequent runs of the application unless moved prior to running the tool.
